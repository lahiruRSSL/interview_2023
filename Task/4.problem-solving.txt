Question: Write a method to check if a given string is an anagram of another string.

1. Implement a method named isAnagram that takes two strings as input.
2. Within the method, remove all non-alphanumeric characters from both input strings (e.g., spaces, punctuation marks).
3. Convert both strings to lowercase to make the anagram check case-insensitive.
4. Sort the characters in both strings alphabetically.
5. Check if the sorted strings are equal to each other.
6. If the sorted strings are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.
7. Consider edge cases such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.
