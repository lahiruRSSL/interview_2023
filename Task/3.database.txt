3. The "orders" table has the following columns: order_id (unique identifier), customer_id (foreign key referencing the customer_id in the "customers" table), purchase_amount (amount spent on the order), and other relevant columns.
4. Write an SQL query to retrieve the top 5 customers who have made the highest total purchase amounts.
5. The result should include the following columns: customer_id, customer_name, order_count (number of orders placed by the customer), and total_purchase_amount (the sum of purchase amounts for all orders placed by the customer).
